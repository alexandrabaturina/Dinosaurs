# Dinographic
## Overview
**Dinographic** is JavaScript-based single-page web app that puts together dinosaur data that is provided as well as user input data and compares them via infographic.

The app is built as Project 1 of Udacity [Intermediate JavaScript Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/intermediate-javascript-nanodegree--nd032). The goal of the project is to improve experience with:
* Building objects with JavaScript 
* User interaction with the DOM
## Features
The **Dinographic** project meets the following requirements.
* The DOM contains a grid of 9 tiles with the following conditions:
  * 7 Dinosaurs with species, image, and random fact displayed
  * 1 Human located in the middle with name from input displayed in place of species and no fact
  * 1 Bird with species, image, and the fact, "*All birds are Dinosaurs.*"
  
* The human object is formed with data pulled from the form when "*Compare me*" button is clicked.

* There are at least 3 methods which compare dino data to the user data from the DOM.
